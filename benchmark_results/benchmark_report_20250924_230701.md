## System Performance Analysis

### Process Management Efficiency
This benchmark tests the efficiency of process termination and restart cycles, which is crucial for:
- System responsiveness
- Process management overhead
- Context switching performance

### Tool-Specific Metrics
Each tool simulates different types of operations:
- **Tape Measure**: Extension/retraction timing
- **Screwdriver**: Rotation and linear advance
- **Welder**: Arc cycles and wire consumption
- **Hammer**: Strike frequency and energy
- **Saw**: Cutting strokes and efficiency
- **Wrench**: Mechanical advantage and torque

### Performance Indicators
- **Lower cycle times** indicate better process management efficiency
- **Consistent timing** across cycles shows system stability
- **Higher performance scores** (cycles/second) indicate better overall performance

## Recommendations

Based on these results:
1. Monitor system load during benchmarks
2. Compare results across different system configurations
3. Use for baseline performance measurements
4. Consider system optimization if cycle times are unusually high
