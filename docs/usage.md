./benchmark.sh -c 20

# Stress testing with high cycle counts
./benchmark.sh -c 100 -t hammer

# Compare specific tools
./benchmark.sh -t tape,measure,welder -c 25

# Performance regression testing
./benchmark.sh --quick  # Baseline test
# ... make system changes ...
./benchmark.sh --quick  # Compare results
```

### Manual Testing System Performance
```bash
# Test with high cycle counts for stress testing
swift tools.swift hammer 100

# Compare different tools for system analysis
swift tools.swift tape measure 50
swift tools.swift welder 50
```

### Educational Use

# Start with simple modes to understand the concept
swift tools.swift screwdriver 5
swift tools.swift wrench 5

# Progress to more complex modes
swift tools.swift saw 10
swift tools.swift welder 10

# Use automated benchmarking for comprehensive learning
./benchmark.sh --quick  # See all tools in action
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Automated consistency testing
./benchmark.sh -c 10
./benchmark.sh -c 10  # Run multiple times to compare

# Manual multiple runs for detailed analysis
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Run $i:"
  swift tools.swift tape measure 10
  echo "---"
done
```

### Benchmark Report Analysis
After running benchmarks, analyze the generated reports:
```bash
# View the latest benchmark report
open benchmark_results/benchmark_report_*.md

# Compare CSV data
cat benchmark_results/summary_*.csv

# Check detailed tool outputs
ls benchmark_results/*_*.txt
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Manual Tool Execution
- **"Please provide an integer argument"**: Make sure you provide both mode and cycle count
- **"Invalid mode"**: Check spelling of tool mode
- **Process termination errors**: Normal behavior - the program restarts itself

#### Benchmark Script
- **"Swift is not installed"**: Install Xcode command line tools or Swift
- **"Permission denied"**: Make the script executable with `chmod +x benchmark.sh`
- **"bc calculator not found"**: Install bc with `brew install bc` (optional, for calculations)
- **"No such file or directory"**: Ensure you're in the correct directory with tools.swift

### Performance Tips
- Start with small cycle counts (5-10) to test
- Monitor system performance during execution
- Use appropriate cycle counts for your system capacity
- Use `--quick` flag for faster initial testing
- Check benchmark logs for detailed error information

## üìà Interpreting Results

### Manual Tool Output Analysis
- **Lower cycle times** = faster system performance
- **Consistent timing** = stable system behavior
- **High variance** = system load or resource contention

### Directional Analysis
- **Net Direction = 0**: Balanced operations (screwdriver, saw, wrench)
- **Net Direction > 0**: Forward progress (welder, hammer)
- **Directional timing differences**: System bias in process handling

### Tool-Specific Metrics
- Compare metrics across different tools
- Analyze efficiency ratios
- Monitor system resource usage patterns

### Benchmark Report Analysis
The automated benchmark generates comprehensive reports with:

#### Performance Summary Table
- **Tool**: Which tool was tested
- **Cycles**: Number of operations performed
- **Duration**: Total execution time
- **Avg Cycle Time**: Average time per operation
- **Performance**: Operations per second (higher is better)

#### System Information
- Hardware specifications
- OS version and architecture
- CPU and memory details
- Benchmark execution timestamp

#### Analysis Sections
- **Process Management Efficiency**: Context switching performance
- **Tool-Specific Metrics**: Physics-based calculations
- **Performance Indicators**: What the metrics mean
- **Recommendations**: How to use the results

#### Detailed Logs
- Individual tool outputs for troubleshooting
- CSV data for further analysis
- Execution logs for debugging

### Best Practices for Analysis
1. **Baseline Testing**: Run benchmarks before system changes
2. **Consistent Conditions**: Test under similar system load
3. **Multiple Runs**: Compare results across several executions
4. **Trend Analysis**: Monitor performance over time
5. **Cross-Platform**: Compare results across different systems
